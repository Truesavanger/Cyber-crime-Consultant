    <h1>Protect Yourself: How to Prevent Phishing Attacks</h1>
    <div class="phishing-type">
        <h2>Be Skeptical of Emails</h2>
        <p>Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments from unsolicited emails. Verify the sender's legitimacy, especially if the email urges immediate action or contains unexpected requests.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="phishing-type">
        <h2>Stay Informed on Smishing and Vishing</h2>
        <p>Be cautious of unexpected SMS messages or phone calls, especially those pressuring you to share personal information. Verify the source independently before responding to such communications.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="phishing-type">
        <h2>Enhance Email Security</h2>
        <p>Implement robust email security measures, including spam filters and email authentication protocols. Educate employees and users about recognizing phishing attempts and reporting suspicious emails.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="phishing-type">
        <h2>Regularly Update Security Software</h2>
        <p>Ensure that your antivirus and anti-malware software is up-to-date. Regularly update your operating system and applications to patch vulnerabilities that attackers may exploit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="phishing-type">
        <h2>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
        <p>Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security. Even if attackers obtain login credentials, MFA requires additional verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
